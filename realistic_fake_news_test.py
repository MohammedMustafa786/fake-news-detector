BREAKING: Secret Documents Reveal COVID-19 Vaccines Contain Mind Control Chips
Washington D.C. - Leaked internal government documents obtained by independent researchers show that all COVID-19 vaccines contain microscopic tracking devices designed to monitor and control human behavior. Dr. Sarah Thompson, a whistleblower from the CDC, claims that these nano-chips can alter brain patterns and make people more compliant to government orders. The documents allegedly show that Big Tech companies are receiving real-time data from vaccinated individuals. Government officials have refused to comment on these explosive revelations. Medical experts are calling for immediate investigation into what they term the "largest conspiracy in human history."

Washington - The Federal Reserve announced a quarter-point increase in the federal funds rate, bringing it to 5.50%, following their two-day policy meeting.

The move was anticipated by most economists, with 18 of 20 analysts surveyed by Reuters predicting the increase. Stock markets showed mixed reactions, with the Dow Jones falling 0.8% while tech stocks gained 1.2%. Powell indicated that future rate decisions will depend on incoming economic data, particularly inflation and employment figures.
